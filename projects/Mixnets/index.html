            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">Mix networks</a> (mixnets) are a type of overlay network following a protocol that protects the users identity and the content of the communication.
            They provide a higher degree of anonymity than other solutions like VPNs or Tor because they shuffle the internet packets multiple times during the communication, breaking correlation techniques using timings. 
            They also cipher the packet's content such that an adversary can not correlate the traffic based on that metric.
            The main challenges for mixnets are to provide anonymity against a very strong threat model while keeping the network latency and throughput acceptable. This is an active area of research.
