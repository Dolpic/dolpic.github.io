        <p>
            As a project with friends, we implemented a working synthesizer taking input from a MIDI source and converting it into an audio signal.<br>
            The main challenge was to compute in real-time the audio stream in a high-level language such as Python, which led to many surprises regarding optimizations.

            The key features are the following :
            <ul>
                <li>Simple UI, showing the signal produced in real-time</li>
                <li>Inputs can be a real-time MIDI device or a specified MIDI file to play</li>
                <li>All the audio primitives (oscillators, filters, ADSR, etc.) are divided into modules that serve as "build-block" for the audio pipeline</li>
                <li>The whole audio pipeline is described in a single file (using the modules), such files can be loaded as plugins</li>
                <li>Filters applied on MIDI notes are supported, such as arpeggiators</li>
                <li>The temperament can be chosen from Equal, Pythagorean or Just</li>
            </ul>
